  <!--- INTRO --->
    <p>It is no secret that the obesity rate is climbing in the United States. From 1999 to 2016, the adult obesity rate has increased from 30.5 to 39.6 and the youth obesity rate has increased from 13.9 to 18.5 (3). It is a disheartening fact because of the multitude of health problems linked to obesity. Those that are obese are more susceptible to type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke, kidney disease, and pregnancy complications (4). It is a health issue that is steadily increasing and many have tried to enforce policies to help. </p>
    <p>In order to have informed policies, it is essential to look at factors that may drive obesity. Many first look to the correlation between household income and obesity. This chart below details the median household income and adult obesity rate of every census tract across the United States. We can see how the obesity rate gets generally higher as median household income decreases. But just because these two are correlated, does not mean that lower income causes people to become obese. </p>

    <!--- INCOME AND OBESITY --->
      <p>Data compilation by Post columnist Tamar Haspel shows the obesity rate of those with low income, middle income and high income (read her full story <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/the-true-connection-between-class-and-obesity-isnt-what-you-probably-think/2018/07/19/8d3a61e4-8ac8-11e8-a345-a1bf7847b375_story.html?utm_term=.139f5b25c0cf">here</a>). In both children and adults, the highest obesity rates are seen at the middle income level.  This reveals that the lowest income does not always directly correlate with the highest obesity rate. However, the lower obesity rate of those with high income level reveals that income is still a factor in driving obesity. </p>
      <p>When it is broken down further and examine the difference between genders, we see that women with the highest obesity rate are in the low income group, while the men with the highest obesity rate are in the middle income group. </p>
      <p>Some of the most interesting information is revealed when the difference in race is considered. For both white and Hispanic populations, the most obese are found in the middle income level. However, for black populations, those in the low income level have the lowest obesity rates, but for Asian populations, those in the low income level have the highest obesity rates.</p>

    <p>This data shows us that when we consider the data in distinct sets, such as gender and race, there is a difference in the correlation between income level and obesity rates. These disparities reveal that there are more factors at play when we look at what drives obesity. While this data does not exclude income as a factor, it tells us that there are more drivers to consider. Such disparities may bring up conversations about food culture, family time, and genetic predispositions. In the conversation about obesity and it’s causes, many researchers have turned to the issue of food environments. </p>

    <!--- FOOD ENVIRONMENTS --->
    <h2>Where are they getting their food?</h2>

    <p>A food environment details the presence or absence of food sources in a person’s environment that may affect or dictate their eating behaviors. For example, if you were sitting at home and were hungry- where could you get food? If you did not have a car, your source would be what is in your home or within walking distance. If you do have a car, examine the food sources you encounter as you leave your house. Is it a convenience store? Fast food restaurant? Full-service grocery store? Do you have access to a club discount store? </p>
    <p>Many researchers examine this when looking for what drives obesity because it makes logical sense. If one has more fast food restaurants than grocery stores, then it is easier for them to get caloric-dense food from a drive thru. The table below details the number of grocery stores, club stores, convenience stores, and fast food restaurants per thousand people in every county in the United States. When the data is organized by obesity rate, one can examine the food environment of the most obese counties. If you compare this to the last pages of the table, which show the food environment of the least obese counties, there is not a drastic difference in the food available to each county. Most counties seem to have more fast food restaurants than grocery stores.  </p>

    <p>If you interact with each of the column headers, you can sort each of the columns. Take a look at the counties with the highest number of fast food restaurants per thousand people. Does it directly correlate with the obesity rate of those counties? Not necessarily. What about grocery stores- does having more grocery stores automatically make those counties less obese? No. This table shows that while food environments may influence the obesity rate, it does not dictate it.</p>
    <p>Further, the graph below examines the relationship between obesity and the population with low access to stores. The counties with the highest population with low access to stores fall in the middle of the total collection of obesity rates.</p>

    <!--- FOOD ENVIRONMENTS --->
    <p>This examination of food environment and obesity reveals that there may be another factor at play-- personal selection. Maybe obesity is driven more by conscious choice of consumers than their food environment. When I examine this factor, I do not want to place the blame on the obese population, but rather examine how caloric-dense foods have gotten more addicting. </p>
    <!--- FOOD ENVIRONMENTS END--->

    <!--- SUGAR ADDICTION --->
    <h2>More sugar, please!</h2>

    <p>When I look at the addictiveness and appeal of caloric-dense foods I want to examine the trends of sugar in foods in the United States. I am specifically examining sugar because of its known addictive effects. The neurobiological effects of consuming sugar induce reward and craving (5). These effects cause sugar-dense foods to be more addictive, and therefore more appealing.</p>
    <p>The chart below examines the sugar deliveries for human consumption by different user groups between 1997 and 2017. While some groups have actually experienced a decrease in sugar deliveries, certain users such as the bakery and cereal products, beverages, and ice cream and dairy products have seen a significant increase. This increase in sugar deliveries by industry reveals that there is an increase in sugar in certain foods. This increase in sugar levels may be contributing to the rise in obesity levels in the United States.</p>

    <!--- CONCLUSION --->
    <p>So the answer to "What drives obesity?" It is not one single issue. It is not solely determined by someones income. It does not correlate directly with the number of fast food restaurants nearby. It may be influenced by higher sugar content. Obesity is not consistent among gender or race. The answer is nowhere, but similarly is everywhere. It is a multifaceted issue that deserves a multi-pronged solution. It will not be fixed by one policy, but rather the careful creation of many. </p>
